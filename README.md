Check if user is behind a VPN or proxy via simple HTTP request.

## Sources

This app is using [X4BNet's list](https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn) of IPs. GrOxyP checks if queried IP is on this
list.

# Installation and usage

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/BOOMfinity/GrOxyP`.
2. Go to directory: `cd GrOxyP/cmd/groxyp`.
3. Build: `go build`.
4. Set environmental variables as in example:

```shell
  GROXYP_DB_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn/main/ipv4.txt"
  GROXYP_DB_FILE = "ips.txt"
  GROXYP_DB_UPDATE_INTERVAL = "4h0m0s"
  GROXYP_PORT = 5656,
  GROXYP_TOKEN: = "such_a_token_wow"
```

5. Run!

HTTP server will be waiting for requests at default port 5656. Query `ip` endpoint like so:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:5656/ip?q=194.35.232.123&token=such_a_token_wow
{"ip":"194.35.232.123","proxy":true,"rule":"194.35.232.0/22"}
```

Invalid token will cause `401 Unauthorized` messages. Other endpoints should respond with `404` message.
